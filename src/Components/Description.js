      Welcome to my Travel Blog Editor! I built this single page application in React as my final project 
      of the Full Stack Web Developer course at Hamburg Coding School. The blog entries are served by my own
        backend application on Heroku and get sorted there descending by recent travel date. For each entry there 
        is a marker on the map with an info window. Clicking on an entrieÂ´s image reveals a detail page with more information.
